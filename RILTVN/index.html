	<p class="drop">Welcome to the Reinventing Local TV News Project at Northeastern University! We are excited to be a PILOT Innovation Challenge Winner and have our research featured at the 2022 NAB Show.</p>
	<p>Here are some links that will help you delve into our research which is supported by the Stanton Foundation.</p>
	<p>In a nutshell: Animation wins! We embedded animators in two television stations for a year and then tested their animated stories against non-animated versions. Viewers responded positively across the board. After viewing the local news stories that took a fresh approach to animation and graphics, viewers preferred that style, with audiences more likely to rate the animated stories as clear, compelling, and memorable.</p>
	<p>This <a href="https://vimeo.com/557755323" target="_blank">video</a> summarizes our research:</p>

	<p>Here are links to four research posts we published with RTDNA, the Radio Television Digital News Association. For people who want to dive deep into our research, these posts include additional videos and a slide deck filled with data about what we did.</p>

	<p>We also <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/case-video-animation-local-tv-news-summary-report-newsrooms/" target="_blank">published a paper</a> about our research with the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School.</p>
	<p>This drive also includes highlight videos from workshops we’ve conducted with television stations across the country. </p>
	<p>And finally, we are providing animation templates that you can use with Adobe Premiere to get started animating stories right away. Each template includes a READ ME file that explains how to use the template and a tutorial video that shows you what the animated template will allow you to do.</p>
