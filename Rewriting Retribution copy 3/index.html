				<p class="drop">The criminal justice system makes incarceration the only way to hold people accountable for crimes they commit. But this approach doesn’t give victims a voice, it doesn’t look at the circumstances that lead people to commit crimes, and it doesn’t take into account the collateral damage to their families. Advocates for restorative justice as an alternative to incarceration believe true justice starts with knowing who is harmed. And then working to repair that harm.  </p>
				<p>“In our current system, you will have hours and hours, and years perhaps, of proceedings,” said Jessica Hedges, a Boston-based defense attorney at Hedges & Tumposky and a survivor of crime who works with restorative justice programs. “The victim is only heard in that system for ten minutes at the final sentencing. Maybe the prosecutor is consulting with the victim [before then] and maybe not.”</p>

				<p>This lack of victim-centered justice led Judge Leo T. Sorokin to found RISE (Repair, Invest, Succeed, Emerge) in the federal district court for Massachusetts in 2015. The program gives some defendants who plead guilty a chance to delay sentencing and possibly avoid incarceration if they address the issues that may have led them to commit crimes and participate in a two-day restorative justice workshop organized by Maria D’Addieco, a federal probation officer with years of experience in the field. </p>
				<p>At the center of the workshop is a circle that brings together those responsible for crime and victims of similar crimes, creating conversations that allow defendants to understand the impacts of crime and work to make amends for harms they’ve caused. </p>
				<p>That’s why RISE, and other programs at the state and local level, may offer a real chance at healing for victims, defendants and their families. Oftentimes, these groups just want a space to feel heard and to get answers — something that isn’t usually granted during prosecution and court proceedings. </p>
				<p>Amanda Ruiz, a survivor of crime, believes that the greatest impact of restorative justice comes from victims being able to directly communicate with the people who hurt them. She serves as the deputy director of programs and operations at Communities for Restorative Justice, or C4RJ. </p>
				<p>“Some impacted parties are really angry, and they just want to let that other person know how much they impacted their lives. Or they have questions, like: ‘Why me? Why did you do this to me? Were you targeting me? Are you going to come back?’ All of those things are really important for a victim to be able to ask the person who harmed them because they can ask their lawyer, the police, even [C4RJ] as an intermediary. But really, the person who has the best answer is the person who caused them harm.”</p>

				<h2>The <span>Myth</span> of the Victimless Crime</h2>
				<p>Many offenders who take part in restorative justice programs are considered to have committed what are sometimes called “victimless” crimes, like selling drugs or guns.</p>

				<p>Janet Connors, who lost her son, Joel, in 2001 and now leads many of the restorative justice circles, emphasizes that crimes affect a whole community, whether there is a specific victim or not.</p>
				<p>“If you follow those drugs, if you follow those guns, how many people get hurt? How many people get killed, How many people get arrested, deported, incarcerated? How many people get addicted? How many people die of overdoses? How many families suffer behind all of that?” Connors said. “And so people [responsible for crimes] then realize, ‘Wow, I have a lot of victims. I never thought about it.’”</p>
				<p>Joel was stabbed to death in his apartment in Dorchester at the hands of four men — three of whom were sent to prison, while the other was acquitted. Since then, she has devoted her life to restorative justice practices, holding circles throughout the Greater Boston area at prisons and in communities, gathering those who’ve committed crimes with survivors. </p>
				
				
				<h2>Focusing on <span>humanity</span></h2>
				<p>For those who’ve lost loved ones due to crime, restorative justice helps them overcome and heal from the tragedies they face. By sitting in circle with people who’ve committed crimes, they can both better understand who harmed them, and on the flip side, they can articulate the ways  they’ve been impacted.</p>

				<p>Clarissa Turner, who now devotes her life to restorative justice work, emphasizes that talking circles provide structure for these conversations. The guided format in circles allows for each person — including victims, responsible parties, loved ones and members of the community — both to listen and to be heard.</p>
				<p>“In circle, we learn how to say what we need to say, release a lot of pain, not one feeling embarrassed to express how they feel or what they've been through,” said Turner, who lost her eldest son, Marquis, to homicide in 2011. “It’s a safe haven place that you can just release. And we know when we do release, we leave space open to receive anew.”</p>
				<p>Robyn Houston-Bean, for example, was so nervous walking into her first circle session in the restorative justice program, following the death of her son, Nicholas, who died of heroin overdose in 2015. This circle included people who pleaded guilty to drug trafficking. She went in with the sole intention of telling them how their types of crime “ruined her life.” But it didn’t go as she expected.</p>
				<p>“It was weird because I expected them all to look like monsters, you know?” she said. “And they didn’t. They just looked like people.”</p>
				<p>By hearing their stories, Houston-Bean was able to understand these people in ways she hadn’t before. She learned about what led them down the path to crime and incarceration. To her surprise, she felt empathy for them. </p>
				<p>“There's people that have grown up in different ways than I did, who had different situations in their family lives than I did, who might have been handed a really crappy, crappy life,” she said. “Then this is where they ended up, probably through no fault of their own. And I don't think I had ever thought of it.”</p>
				<p>The word “monster” came up frequently among those interviewed for this piece. For Connors, she wanted his killers to face the impacts of their actions and work toward repairing the harm. And for that to happen, she reminded herself that her son’s killers were people, not monsters, and that they should not behave as monsters would.</p>
				<p>“If I think of them as monsters, I absolve them of their responsibility,” she said. “Holding them in their humanity is what makes them accountable.”</p>
				
				
				<h2>An opportunity for reflection and <span>redemption <span></h2>
				<p>On the flip side of Robyn’s experience, it wasn’t until a circle session that Tavon Robinson had realized how victims and other people viewed him. When a woman opened up the circle, she talked about how her daughter did not come because she did not want to be surrounded by monsters.</p>

				<p>“It hit me hard… Because I don't feel like I'm a monster. But I had to actually now see through the eyes of a woman whose child overdosed and died off of a product that I was helping be responsible at times for putting in the world… It opened my eyes.”</p>
				<p>Robinson was incarcerated twice and completed the restorative justice program following his second sentence. For him, restorative justice has made the difference between falling back into patterns of harm by addressing his issues head-on and changing for the better. </p>
				<p>“I was probably 85, 90% sure I wouldn't commit crimes anymore when I came home from prison. And after that second time when I started to change my life, restorative justice made it 100%.”</p>
				<p>Robinson’s transformation also resonated with his attorney, Hedges, who is a victim of crime herself.</p>
				<p>“The last thing I want is for the people who victimized me to be put in a situation where they're going to become more likely to victimize others, more damaged, more marginalized and more hopeless.”</p>
				<p>Robinson is not alone. Restorative justice approaches have shown evidence of dropping recidivism rates. In one 2014 case, a restorative justice program in Longmont, Colorado, even resulted in a recidivism rate of 8%, contrasting with a 60-70% rate for those who’ve gone through traditional justice systems.</p>
				<p>In fact, a national study by the Prison Policy Initiative found that more than a quarter of those released from prison reoffend in the first year.</p>
				<container><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13233898"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> </container>
				<p>Not only are responsible parties working toward a better way of life through restorative justice practices, but they often feel remorse for others’ losses and empathize with those in their circle.</p>
				<p>This has happened several times in Turner’s experience, and is one of the most powerful moments for her. This, she said, is the beginning of their healing journey.</p>
				<p>“Don't just tell me sorry because you think I want to hear it, but I want you to mean it,” she said. “Because when you mean you're sorry, then that's been your process of healing begins. Because that’s telling me you are holding yourself accountable, your own what you did. Now you want to mend. Now you want to be better, show up better, not just for me or the community, but for your own family who you harmed.”</p>
				
				
				<h2><span>Repairing</span> relationships with one’s self, family and community</h2>
				<p>While restorative justice is centered around victims, the support provided offenders can be priceless. Reintegration into society and with family, is a common goal many share for participating in restorative justice. </p>

						<h2>J.C. Anderson</h2>

					</div>
				</div>
				
				<p>J.C. Anderson is no stranger to that goal. Restorative justice gave Anderson a new outlook on life to be “the father, the brother, the dad to my kids who I wanted to [be]; it made me see that light of being a positive person in the community and to my family.”</p>
				<p>Anderson had been incarcerated four times before he participated in the restorative justice program, and he hit this turning point that Turner mentioned. At the heart of restorative justice, he said, is honesty. Only by being honest with himself about his actions and impacts, he was able to recognize that he had to be a better man.</p>
				<p>“Some of us are grown men, but we're boys inside, you know? And this makes you be a man, makes you step up to the plate and know that you [have] done wrong,” he said. “And it takes a man to be able to apologize to some people that you've hurt in the past.</p>
				<p>His main motivation for restorative justice, like many of those who’ve been incarcerated, is family. Before restorative justice, Anderson said he was a good “provider” for his children, but felt he wasn’t a good father figure. Now, having gone through the program, he is working toward being a better support system and more positive influence in their lives.</p>
				<p>“I didn't want to look over my shoulder no more,” he said. “I wanted to be normal. I wanted to be a father. I wanted to go to basketball games. I wanted to throw a ball with my kid outside in the yard.”</p>

				<p>Similarly, Jefferson Hudson, who was incarcerated for 35 years, started his restorative justice journey while in prison, and ultimately became one of the founding members of the Transformational Prison Project. He said his grandchildren gave him the strength to do the program.</p>
				<p>“I remember my granddaughter told me, ‘Granddad, you got to do whatever you need to do to get better so you can come home to us,’” Hudson said. “And I was like, ‘I really gotta go all in.’” </p>
				<p>Personally, Anderson also found greater self-worth and self-esteem — qualities that also empowered him to be a better member for his community. </p>
				<p>He didn’t used to believe in himself, and his low sense of dignity prevented him from engaging with his community in a meaningful way. Now, he has gained confidence and learned how simple greetings like “Hi, how are you?” and “Good morning” can go a long way in reintegrating with the community. For him, this has been a first step to getting his community to know his new, changed self.</p>
				<p>“[Restorative justice] broke me down, but it built me up to understand what a father is or what a person is in the community or how you’re gonna move to make others understand that you're not that type of person,” Anderson said. “If somebody reads about you, you could be judged, but [by] getting to know you, they’ll understand that you're a different person. And it really helped me believe in myself to let others believe in me.”</p>
				
				
				<h2>What now? More than a<span> practice</span></h2>
				<p>Restorative justice is more than an act. Proponents of the program call it a lifestyle. </p>
				<p>To those who’ve gone through it, restorative justice may be much more beneficial than the current system — proponents call it a lifestyle. </p>

				<p>Armand Coleman spent nearly four decades in prison, and after finding restorative justice, he not only worked through his traumas, but gained lessons in how to make meaningful change in his own life. </p>
				<p>“One thing I learned through restorative justice is that anytime I have an irrational reaction to everyday experiences, it means my trauma is being triggered,” he said. “All prison did was compound those traumas, and it just made me worse.”</p>
				<p>Coleman became one of the founders of the Transformational Prison Project and serves as executive director.</p>
				<p>However, the implementation of restorative justice still has room for improvement. </p>

				<p>Jane Peachy is a public defender who refers many clients to restorative justice. She said restorative justice helps her clients find understanding and empathy in a way that makes communities a safer place to live. That being said, she believes that communities should have a more active role in the process of restorative justice.</p>
				<p>“Why is it that its lawyers and probation are running this program and not members of the community?” she said.</p>
				<p>However, the implementation of restorative justice still has room for improvement. </p>
				<p>not only worked through his traumas, but gained lessons in how to make meaningful change in his own life. </p>
				<p>Coleman echoed some of Peachy’s sentiments in saying “I realized the people who needed restorative justice the most weren't getting it, [it’s stuck in], the suburbs [and] academia.” He wants to see it built into other systems like the Department for Youth Services and take it to “every inlet of the system.” </p>
				<p>“One thing I learned through restorative justice is that anytime I have an irrational reaction to everyday experiences, it means my trauma is being triggered.” Before Coleman participated in restorative justice, he said, “All prison did was compound those traumas. And it just made me worse. I mean, especially going inside where I had no ability to regulate my emotions.”</p>
				<p>Restorative justice is not something that should be stuck in the suburbs or a one-time encounter with a circle. The process should be transformational and taken back to the communities who are hurt the most. So, how does the circle expand? </p>
				<p>Beyond restorative justice not meeting people where they are, it may not be for all victims. Marquez Turner chose to not do restorative justice with his mother. Unlike his mother, he is not ready to forgive the killers. </p>
				<p>“The forgiveness part — me, personally, I can't do that. I haven't even seen their faces yet. Well, my mom, I honor her for doing that, though, because it takes a lot of strength to do that, especially for a woman that’s been through what she’s been through.”</p>
				<p>He acknowledges that he’ll go to a circle one day, but he’s still in the process of accepting his brother’s death. </p>
