    <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 180px; margin-right: 180px;">One of the most commonly violated regulations in Boston restaurants is related to food storage and handling. Many violations are related to improper storage of food at incorrect temperatures, such as leaving food out at room temperature for too long or failing to refrigerate perishable items. Another common violation is the improper labeling of food items, which can lead to confusion and potential health risks for customers. These violations can lead to the growth of harmful bacteria and can cause foodborne illnesses. Restaurants found in violation of these regulations may receive a conditional pass or fail grade and may be subject to fines and closure until the issues are resolved.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 180px; margin-right: 180px;">Another frequently violated regulation in Boston restaurants is related to sanitation and cleanliness. This can include violations such as not properly cleaning and sanitizing cooking equipment and utensils, failing to maintain clean floors and surfaces, and inadequate handwashing practices. These violations can lead to the growth of harmful bacteria and increase the risk of food contamination. Restaurants found in violation of these regulations may also receive a conditional pass or fail grade and may be subject to fines and closure until the issues are resolved. It's essential for restaurants to prioritize and maintain high levels of cleanliness and sanitation to ensure the safety and well-being of their customers.</p>
