            From the 1920s to the 1990s, the number of Asian actresses on screen started with just one lonely figure and grew slowly. Early on, top credit roles were rare and limited to a handful of actresses like Anna May Wong and Nancy Kwan. Around the 1990s, the market opened up for more Asian women characters, and more of them had a chance to play the leading role.

            “Starring” refers to the main actors or performers who are prominently featured in a production, while “Cast” represents all other roles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Only 91 are listed as top credited out of 1105 productions in total, meaning that only approximately 8% of the productions that these 37 actresses participated in are primarily centered on the character of Asian women.

            The descriptions of those top credited productions from IMbD provide a closer viewpoint of the changes that happened over time.

                <p>Stereotypes rely on the othering of characters. With the description of roles in the early days, we can see the characters’ identities are tied closely to the country they or their families were originally from, even if that information barely has any relevance ton the plot. Such portrayal distanced the audience from the Asian community in a subtle way and left room for stereotypes to grow.                </p>
                <p>With the shifting of time, the use of the more general “Asian” slowly replaced the former identity, and actresses started to play roles that had nothing to do with where they were from.</p>
                <p> In 2018, the character of Rachel in “Crazy Rich Asians” was described as a “native New Yorker,” this character’s identity is tied to the U.S.. It’s a sign of inclusion as well as a reflection on social change.</p>

        <p>Normally it would take a few years for an actress to get a top credit role. But for Lisa Lu, that number is 40, for Tsai Chin, it’s 42. “ I think all of you women understand this, as the days, the years, and the numbers get bigger, it seems like opportunities start to get smaller as well.” Michelle Yeoh said when she accepted the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical in 2023. It is their persistence that gives them the chance to stand in the center of the stage.</p></div>

        <div class="articale"><p>Tsai Chin’s role in “Lucky Grandma” (2019) and Lisa Lu’s role in “The Disappearance of Mrs. Wu” (2021) both showed an innovative perspective from Asian elderly women. The characters are not the cliche of a nice old grandma, but a complex woman with internal struggles and rich emotions. Lu is now 97 years old and still participating in movie production, she is living proof that age can’t stop one from the career they are enthusiastic about.</p></div>

We are not like that.”. The characters for her at that time were always limited to certain types. “The screen’s foremost Oriental villainess,” Time magazine dubbed her in her obituary when she died of a heart attack in 1961.</p>
