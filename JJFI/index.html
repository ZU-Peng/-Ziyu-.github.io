  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>International journalists struggle with a lack of connections and information when it comes to getting a newsroom job in the US.</p>

  <p>That’s why we started Journalism Jobs for Internationals. Our target audience is global journalists who want to work here and newsrooms seeking to become more diverse and inclusive. </p>
    
  <p>Our first step is to build an informational platform of newsrooms that hire journalists with visas or will sponsor them. At this point, our list is small. We hope – with your help – to expand it. So if you know of a newsroom or newsrooms that will hire journalists with visas.</p>
