      <h1>Restorative justice and its power to heal</h1>
      <p>The current criminal justice system places punishment as the goal for accountability to crime.</p>
        <p>But this approach does not give any agency to victims.        </p>
        <p>“In our current system, you will have hours and hours, and years perhaps, of proceedings,” said Jessica Hedges, a Boston-based defense attorney at Hedges & Tumposky LLP and a survivor of crime and a defense attorney. “And the victim is only heard in that system for 10 minutes at the final sentencing, and maybe the prosecutor is consulting with the victim and maybe not.”</p>
        <p>This lack of victim-centered justice led to the birth of the RISE program and the Restorative Justice Program, or RJ. Both programs aim to create conversations with victims that allow defendants to understand the impacts of crime and work to make amends for those harms. This program started in 2015 and is part of the Massachusetts federal district court system.</p>
        <p>Achieving true justice starts with knowing who is harmed. And then working to repair that harm. </p>
        <p>Many offenders who take part in these restorative justice programs are considered having committed “victimless” crimes. This means there are no direct people targeted in the crime, like in drug distribution.</p>
        <p>Janet Connors, however, emphasizes that crimes, whether there is a specific victim or not, affect a whole community.</p>
        <p>“If you follow those drugs, if you follow those guns, how many people get hurt? How many people get killed, How many people get arrested, deported, incarcerated? How many people get addicted? How many people die of overdoses? How many families suffer behind all of that? And so people then realize, ‘Wow, I have a lot of victims. I never thought about it.’”</p>
        <p>Connors lost her son, Joel, on Jan. 31, 2001. Joel was stabbed to death in his own apartment in Dorchester at the hands of four men — three of whom were sent to prison, while the other was not charged due to reasonable doubt.</p>
        <p>Since then, she has devoted her life to restorative justice practices and healing circles. Connors now holds many circles throughout the Greater Boston area at courts, prisons, schools and other community centers, gathering those who’ve committed crimes with survivors.</p>

      <h1>Clarissa Turner</h1>
      <p>Clarissa Turner emphasizes that talking circles provide structure, by creating a guided format for conversations between victims, offenders and other members of the community, which allows each person both to listen and to be heard.</p>

        <p>“In circle, we learn how to say what we need to say, release a lot of pain, not one feeling embarrassed to express how they feel or what they've been through. It’s a safe haven place that you can just release. And we know when we do release, we leave space open to receive anew.” </p>
        <p>Turner lost her eldest son, Marquis, to homicide in 2011. He is survived by two sons and a daughter whom he never got to meet.
        </p>
        <p>She was introduced to restorative justice by Connors, whom Turner calls a “beautiful mentor, beautiful angel in the midst of my worst time.” They often work alongside each other holding circles, and Turner also started a nonprofit organization called Legacy Lives On, which is a support system for families affected by homicide.
        </p>
        <p>For Turner, one of the most powerful things she sees in circles is individuals taking responsibility and feeling remorse for their actions. This, she said, is the beginning of their healing journey.
        </p>
        <p>“For an individual in a circle to say to me, ‘I didn't kill your son, but I harmed somebody else. But I'm sorry for what that person did to you’ — do you know what I did to me the first time that happened? I was like, ‘Oh my God, that's all I want. For these kids to acknowledge. Don't just tell me sorry because you think I want to hear it, but I want you to mean it. Because when you mean you're sorry, then that's been your process of healing begins. Because that’s telling me you are holding yourself accountable, your own what you did. Now you want to mend. Now you want to be better, show up better, not just for me or the community, but for your own family who you harmed.”
